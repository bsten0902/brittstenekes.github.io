The migration towards virtual work and remote learning 
during this pandemic engenders glaring mental health concerns.
I sought to disclose factors that affect employee mental health 
with statistical significance. 

These are questions we explored:
1.	Could lack of resources to seek mental health support promote poor health?
2.	Does lack of discussion of mental health in the workplace promote poor health?
3.	Are there differences between male health versus female health in the tech industry? If so, why?

We used the Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) non-profit corporation's annual

for the analysis.
