Toner Inc. devlops and manufactures document management systems.
They deploy mechanics in vans to fix customer's equipment.

Problem: The largest competitor has a faster average response time than Toner Inc. (3-hours on average).

By fitting probability distributions to call center data,
I develop, test, and use an object-oriented simulation to reduce mechanic response time below 3 hours.
